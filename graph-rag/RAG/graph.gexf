They presented the Olympic flame to Agnes Shea, a gesture that was seen as a symbol of the event's global significance. However, their actions were also met with protests from Tibetan activists who sought to raise awareness about the region's autonomy concerns. Amidst this complex backdrop, Chinese officials continued to highlight the unity and cooperation that the Olympics represented." />
