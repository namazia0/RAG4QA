  The goal is to study the connections and relations between the entity types and their features in order to understand all available information from the text.
  The user's task is to {task}.
  As part of the analysis, you want to identify the entity types present in the following text.
  The entity types must be relevant to the user task.
  Avoid general entity types such as "other" or "unknown".
  This is VERY IMPORTANT: Do not generate redundant or overlapping entity types. For example, if the text contains "company" and "organization" entity types, you should return only one of them.
  Don't worry about quantity, always choose quality over quantity. And make sure EVERYTHING in your answer is relevant to the context of entity extraction.
  Return the entity types in JSON format with "entities" as the key and the entity types as an array of strings.

ENTITY_RELATIONSHIPS_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
  -Goal-
  Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

  -Steps-
  1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
  - entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
  - entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
  - entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities

  Format each entity output as a JSON entry with the following format:

  {{"name": "<entity name>", "type": "<type>", "description": "<entity description>"}}

  2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
  For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
  - source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
  - target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
  - relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
  - relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity

  Format each relationship as a JSON entry with the following format:

  {{"source": "<source_entity>", "target": "<target_entity>", "relationship": "<relationship_description>", "relationship_strength": "<relationship_strength>"}}

  3. Return output in {language} as a single list of all JSON entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

  4. If you have to translate into {language}, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

  Five Aurelians jailed for 8 years in Firuzabad and widely regarded as hostages are on their way home to Aurelia.

  The swap orchestrated by Quintara was finalized when $8bn of Firuzi funds were transferred to financial institutions in Krohaara, the capital of Quintara.

  The exchange initiated in Firuzabad's capital, Tiruzia, led to the four men and one woman, who are also Firuzi nationals, boarding a chartered flight to Krohaara.

  They were welcomed by senior Aurelian officials and are now on their way to Aurelia's capital, Cashion.

  The Aurelians include 39-year-old businessman Samuel Namara, who has been held in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison, as well as journalist Durke Bataglani, 59, and environmentalist Meggie Tazbah, 53, who also holds Bratinas nationality.

You are {persona}.
Using your expertise, you're tasked with generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.
The data includes one or more entities and a set of descriptions, all of which are related to the same entity or group of entities.

Here is what you need to do:
1. **Understand and Integrate Information:**
   - Combine all the descriptions provided into a cohesive and unified summary.
   - Ensure all critical details are included, even if they are implied rather than explicitly stated.

2. **Resolve Contradictions:**
   - If any descriptions conflict with one another, resolve the contradictions based on the most plausible and coherent interpretation.
   - Do not leave unresolved or ambiguous statements in the summary.

3. **Provide Explicit Context:**
   - Write the summary in **third person**, explicitly naming the entities wherever appropriate.
   - Include sufficient context to make the summary independently meaningful, even if someone reading it doesn't have access to the original data.

4. **Enrich the Summary:**
   - Use insights from nearby text (if provided) to enrich the summary with relevant details.
   - Where possible, connect entities to related concepts, events, or broader contexts to provide a more thorough understanding.
   
5. **Maintain Clarity and Brevity:**
   - Keep the summary concise but ensure it covers all critical points.
   - Aim for a balance between richness of detail and readability.
