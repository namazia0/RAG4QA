Prediction: The discovery of stromules occurred during the late 19th century, specifically in the early 20th century. This discovery was made by a German scientist named Carl von Linde, who was working on the study of organic compounds and their properties. Linde's work led him to discover that certain organic molecules could be broken down into smaller, simpler molecules called "stromules." Stromules are now known as "organic compounds" and are used in various fields such as chemistry,
